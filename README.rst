SQS Workers
===========

SQS Workers gives the ability to process messages off an SQS queue using
multiple worker threads. It uses python multithreading to optimize CPU
usage since a good portion of time is spent requesting messages and
polling the SQS queue. It can be used similarly to an AWS Lambda which
cannot (as of right now) be used in conjunction with SQS.


Usage
=====

A basic call to SQS Workers would look like this:

.. code:: python

    from sqsworkers import MessageMetadata
    from sqsworkers.crew import Crew


    class MyMessageProcessor:
        def __init__(self, msg):
            self.metadata = MessageMetadata(msg)

        def start(self):
            print(f"metadata: {self.metadata}")

    crew = Crew(
        sqs_session=my_session,
        queue_name=my_queue_name,
        message_processor=MyMessageProcessor
    )

    crew.start()

The `tests <tests/test_crew.py>`__ should be informative
