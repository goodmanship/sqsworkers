SQS Workers
===========

SQS Workers gives the ability to process messages off an SQS queue using
multiple worker threads. It uses python multithreading to optimize CPU
usage since a good portion of time is spent requesting messages and
polling the SQS queue. It can be used similarly to an AWS Lambda which
cannot (as of right now) be used in conjunction with SQS.

.. code:: python

    options = {
        'sqs_session': sqs_session,
        'queue_name': 'ddev-test-queue',
        'sqs_resource': sqs_resource,
        'MessageProcessor': MsgProcessor,
        'logger': msg_logger,
        'statsd': statsd,
        'sentry': None,
        'worker_limit': 1
      }
      c = Crew(**options)
